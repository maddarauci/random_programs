# what is fortran?
Fortran is a computer programming language that is extensively used in numerical, 
scientific computing. 
While outwith the scientific communuity, Forntran has declined in popularity over the 
years, it has a strong user base with scientific programmers, and is alos used in
organisations such as weather forecasters, financial trading, and in engineering simulations. Fortran programs can be highly optimised to run on high performance computers, and in general the language is suited to producing code where performance is important.

Fortran is a compiled langauge, or more specifically it is compiled ahead-of-time. in other words, you must perform a special step called compilation of your written code before you are able to run unt on a computer.
